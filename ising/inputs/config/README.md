Config format
=============

The config file is written in YAML. It must has the following parameters:

*benchmark:* [str] the workload file name, corresponding to the problem type set in API.

*iter_list:* [positive int] also called as trail length, the number (integer) of iterations to run in the solver. Multiple values can be defined so that solvers will run with different trail length.

*solvers:* [str] solvers to run. Options include: BRIM, SA, bSB, dSB, SCA, Multiplicative, all

*nb_runs:* [positive int] number (integer) of trials to run.

*use_gurobi:* use local gurobi to simulate if True, otherwise use local solver if False. This will override *solvers*.

*use_multiprocessing:* Whether to run the multiple runs with multithreading or not.

*nb_threads:* [positive int] the amount of threads used for multiprocessing.

*initialization_seed:* seed to initialize the initial spin states.

*gen_logfile:* [bool] whether generate HDF5 log file that records all spin updating details (Default: False if not defined.)

*weight_constant:* penalty value added to the constraints in the TSP formulation.

## Following parameters are required only when the targeted benchmark is MIMO.

*SNR:* [int] the Signal Noise Ratio value (integer) at which the MIMO problem is going to be solved. Multiple values can also be given.

*nb_trials*: [positive int] amount of symbols each user needs to send. More means the BER will be more correct.
