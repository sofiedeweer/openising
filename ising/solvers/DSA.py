        Perform optimization using a variation of the simulated annealing algorithm.
        This variation works with cycles where each node must be considered for a flip before
        a node is considered for a flip again. Temperature is lowered between cycles.

        Arguments:
            model: An instance of the IsingModel to be optimized. This defines the energy function.
            initial_state: A 1D numpy array (of 1 and -1's) representing the starting state of the system.
            num_iterations: Number of iterations (steps) for the simulated annealing process.
            initial_temp: Initial temperature for the annealing schedule.
            cooling_rate: Multiplicative factor applied to the temperature after each iteration (0 < cooling_rate < 1).
            seed: (Optional) Seed for the random number generator to ensure reproducibility.
            file: (Optional) Path to an HDF5 file for logging the optimization process. If `None`,
                  no logging is performed.
            clock_freq (float): frequency of the clock cycle
            clock_op (int): amount of operations that can be performed per clock cycle.

        Returns:
            A tuple containing:
                - The optimized state as a 1D numpy array.
                - The final energy of the system.
